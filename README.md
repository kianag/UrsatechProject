# Ursatech Project - Analyzing the Gender Disparity Among Higher Academia in Computer Science / Engineering

- **Organization:** Ursatech Berkeley https://ursatechberkeley.com/
    - UrsaTech partners with student organizations to facilitate creative and impactful initiatives using computer science. We give back to our campus community by providing pro-bono consulting services within the UC Berkeley community and lending our expertise to university-affiliated groups
- **Date:** 2020
- **Position:** Data Consultant
- **Project Goal:** Our client's objective is to uncover and mitigate the roadblocks that prevent minority groups from pursuing successful academic and professional careers in CS/Engineering. Ursatech will pursue a data analysis project that involves scraping the web to amalgamate and identify patterns within university demographic data. This will help us determine how students progress through CS/Engineering programs in undergrad, graduate programs, and/or faculty positions, with a focus on gender.
