# UrsatechProject - Gender Breakdown in Higher Academic for CS/Engineering in the US

- **Organization:** Ursatech Berkeley https://ursatechberkeley.com/
    - UrsaTech partners with student organizations to facilitate creative and impactful initiatives using computer science. We give back to our campus community by providing pro-bono consulting services within the UC Berkeley community and lending our expertise to university-affiliated groups
- **Position:** Data Consultant
- **Project Partner:** Bias Busters https://biasbusters.berkeley.edu/
- **Project Goal:** One of Bias Bustersâ€™ main objectives is to uncover and mitigate the roadblocks that prevent minority groups from pursuing successful academic and professional careers in CS/Engineering. In order to assist with this goal, UrsaTech will pursue a data analysis project that involves scraping the web to amalgamate and identify patterns within university demographic data. This will help us determine how students progress through CS/Engineering programs in undergrad, graduate programs, and/or faculty positions. My focus for this project was gender.
